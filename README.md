## A primer in R for Stata and SPSS users

Stata and SPSS are very user friendly statistical packages, and especially in the case of Stata,
have extensive methods available. However, some important HSR methods are only available, or are
much easier to implement, in the free statistical program R. Unfortunately, the initial learning
curve for using R is a roadblock for many researchers. This workshop serves to remove that roadblock.
Bring your lunch and laptop for a hands on learning experience. Learn how to install R and RStudio,
transfer data between R and Stata, make plots, install an R package, and other basic functions.
